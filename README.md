# NewUserProject

For this project, the following languages will be used:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- React Library

The objective of the project is simple, yet has a few features that will make it a bit more intresting. Some of the features I am referring to are the application of modal for an invalid entry. Also a way to get rid of the modal by clicking the background instead of the "OKAY" button.
